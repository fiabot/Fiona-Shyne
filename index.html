              <p>Hi, I am Fiona. I started my Ph.D studies in the Fall of 2023 at Northeastern University in Boston. I research computational tools for developing content for games, particularly Tabletop Roleplaying Games. I believe the computational advancements and Artificial Intelligence should be designed to best suit the needs of the people that use them, and particularly are useful to lower the barrier of entry for people with creative pursuits but a lack of technical experience. The stories and experiences that can be brought out by games shouldn't be limited to those with the time and skill to execute them. Similarly, the role of computational tools should be augmenting the abilities of the human designer, not attempting to overstep or replace them. </p>
              
              <p>I also make games myself, on occasion. I make small, weird (and often buggy) games that focus on experimentation and storytelling. Through my game development, I have explored mental health and the queer experience. </p>
