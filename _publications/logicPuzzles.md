abstract: "Logic grid puzzles are a popular variety of pen-and-paper puzzles. In logic grid puzzles, players are given natural language hints that they use to mark relationships between entities on a grid. We demonstrate the ability of a Feasible-Infeasible Two-Population (FI-2Pop) genetic algorithm to produce high-quality logic grid puzzles. Hints are constructed using a hand-authored grammar that represents typical types of hints. Infeasible individuals are evolved to approach becoming solvable. Feasible individuals are optimized based on estimated difficulty and hint count. The final evolved puzzles require deductive reasoning skills of the player and were found challenging by the authors of this paper."
