<h3>The Tragedy of Lady Lavender</h3>
<p>This is an interactive fiction game, inspired by the mechanics of "Her Story." In this game you play as a young queer girl trying to uncover documents about the history of your culture, and the beloved figure "Lady Lavender." Discover the truth about the mysterious disappearance of Lady Lavender, and the parts of history you weren't supposed to hear about. This game explores the purposeful the erasure of queer history, and how what is "traditional" is defined by those in power.   </p>

<h3>Let Me Remember</h3>
<p>
Your grandmother was diagnosed with dementia and is slowly losing her memories overtime. The only thing you can do, is to spend the time you can and record her memories as best as you can. In this top down game, you must capture the memories you can before time runs out. This was made in a week for the Brackeys Game Jam where it ranked 15 in innovation, and 125 overall out of 1.7k entries.

<h3>Pink Blobs Eat Pink Food</h3>
<p>Pink Blobs eat pink food, but what if they didn't? This game is a (not so subtle) metaphor for gender, and how expectations can limit your perspective. As the first game I published, and one made only it a weekend, it is a buggy quacky experience. While certainly not a AAA title, Pink Blobs still holds a dear place in my hear and I hope it can bring folk some amusement.   </p>
